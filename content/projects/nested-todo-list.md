####Problem
I wanted an overview of what I studied and be able to drill down to the specific subtopic.

Users can sign up, login, create multiple lists and only see their own list.

- Testing: Jest, Jest-MongoDB, React Testing Library, Cypress for automated end-to-end testing
- Misc: Axios, Dotenv

####Accomplishments
