What used to cost S$14 per year is now $688 because it has become a premium domain. </p>\n<p>I decided to use Github pages instead. First I had to rename my repository name from <code class=\"language-text\">my-blog</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">jenlky.github.io</code> so the url will be the latter rather than <code class=\"language-text\">jenlky.github.io/my-blog</code>. </p>\n<p>Next they recommend downloading <code class=\"language-text\">gh-pages</code> and adding a deploy script <code class=\"language-text\">gh-pages -d dist</code>. This is to push the build from <code class=\"language-text\">/dist</code> folder to <code class=\"language-text\">gh-pages</code> branch. I changed it to <code class=\"language-text\">gh-pages -d public</code> because GatsbyJS output the build to public folder instead.</p>\n<p>Github pages</p>\n<p>Next I tried to run my blog. It turns out that GatsbyJS is now on v5.13 while mine was still running on v2.0. I took a look at the documentation <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v2-to-v3/\">https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v2-to-v3/</a> and figured out that it only runs on Node 10. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating Blog from Netlify to Github Pages","date":"16 February 2024"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/migrating-blog-from-netlify-to-github-pages/"}}
